# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Shradha Dinesh** :wave:,<br>
I'm graduating this spring (2024) from William & Mary with a degree in data science (concentration in spatial data analysis) and political journalism (a self-designed major). I'm passionate about producing journalism with data through visualizations, ML/NLP analyses, or your everyday Excel number crunch. 

I'm currently thinking about data journalism as a policy and accountability tool, and I'm excited to work on my front-end development tool kit. This semester, I'm digging into data visualization beyond Python (R, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript) and am giving remote sensing a go!

I currently serve as the Co-director of [DisinfoLab](https://www.disinfolab.wm.edu/) (a student-run mis/disinformation research lab), associate data editor at the Flat Hat, and graphics/exhibit designer at the Special Collections Research Center at Earl Gregg Swem Library. I am also a [student reporting fellow](https://www.wm.edu/as/charlescenter/about/news/sharp-journalism-fellows-investigate-local-global-issues.php) at the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, working on a long-term climate story.
