# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Shradha Dinesh** :wave:,<be>

I'm passionate about producing journalism with data and graphics. 

*I'm looking for my next gig as a journalist-developer in a newsroom passionate about expanding data coverage to all beats and finding creative ways to make data and data literacy accessible to reporters and readers.*

I'm interested in data as a source for accountability journalism, focusing on creating original datasets/databases and analyses with statistics/machine learning, remotely sensed data, and data visualization. In 2024, I graduated from William & Mary with a degree in data science.

Currently (since August 2024): data journalist @ the [Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/howard-center-for-investigative-journalism) (via the [Dow Jones News Fund](https://www.dowjonesnewsfund.org/news/djnf-announces-intern-class-of-2024/))
