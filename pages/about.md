# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Shradha Dinesh** :wave:,<be>

I'm passionate about producing accountability journalism with data. 

*I'm looking for my next gig as a journalist-developer in a newsroom enthusiastic about expanding data coverage to all beats and finding creative ways to make data and data literacy accessible to reporters and readers.*

I'm interested in data as a source for accountability journalism, focusing on creating original datasets/databases and analyses with statistics/machine learning, remotely sensed data, and data visualization. In 2024, I graduated from William & Mary with a degree in data science.

Currently (since January 2025): data fellow @ McClatchy DC/Miami Herald
