# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Shradha Dinesh** :wave:,<br>
I'm graduating this spring (2024) from William & Mary with a degree in data science (concentration in geospatial analysis) and political journalism (a self-designed major). I'm passionate about producing journalism with data through visualizations, ML/NLP analyses, or your everyday Excel number crunch. 

I'm currently thinking about data journalism as a policy and accountability tool, and I'm excited to work on my front-end development and project management skills. 

I currently serve as the Co-director of [DisinfoLab](https://www.disinfolab.wm.edu/) (a student-run mis/disinformation research lab), associate data editor of the Flat Hat, and design exhibits for the Special Collections Research Center at Earl Gregg Swem Library. I am also a student reporting fellow at the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting!
