# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Shradha Dinesh** :wave:,<be>

I recently graduated from William & Mary with a B.S. in data science (concentration in spatial data analysis) and political journalism (a self-designed major). I'm passionate about producing journalism with data and graphics. 

I'm continuing to explore data as a source of policy and accountability journalism, focusing on creating original datasets, statistics/machine learning, remotely sensed data, and data visualization.

Currently: data journalism intern @ the [Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/howard-center-for-investigative-journalism) (via the [Dow Jones News Fund](https://www.dowjonesnewsfund.org/news/djnf-announces-intern-class-of-2024/))
